    "# Getting Started with JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. It provides a flexible, web-based interface for working with a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and more. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of getting started with JupyterLab, including installation, interface overview, and essential features.\n"

    "## Interface Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch JupyterLab, your default web browser will open, displaying the JupyterLab interface. Here's a brief overview of the main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Menu Bar**: At the top of the interface, you'll find the menu bar, which contains various menus like File, Edit, View, Run, Kernel, etc. These menus provide access to different functionalities and options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Work Area**: The central area is where you'll do most of your work. It consists of tabs, which can contain notebooks, code files, text files, terminals, and other content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Left Sidebar**: The sidebar on the left provides access to the file browser, running kernels and terminals, command palette, and other extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Right Sidebar**: Similar to the left sidebar, the right sidebar hosts additional panels like the inspector, file properties, and other extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Notebook Interface**: When you open a notebook, it appears in the main work area. A notebook consists of cells, which can contain code, text, equations, or visualizations. You can execute code cells, edit text cells, and perform various operations on the notebook.\n"

    "## Essential Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore some essential features of JupyterLab:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating a New Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new notebook, click on the \"+\" icon in the left sidebar and select \"Notebook\" under the desired kernel (e.g., Python 3). This will open a new notebook in a new tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Running Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "In a notebook, you can execute code cells by selecting them and clicking the \"Run\" button in the toolbar or by pressing \"Shift + Enter\" on your keyboard. Output from the code will be displayed below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add text, headers, lists, links, and more using Markdown cells. To create a Markdown cell, select a cell and change its type to \"Markdown\" in the toolbar or by pressing \"Esc + M\" while in command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. File Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "The file browser in the left sidebar allows you to navigate your file system, create new files, upload files, and organize your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Kernel Management\n",
    "\n",
    "You can manage kernels (execution environments) from the kernel menu in the menu bar. This includes starting new kernels, interrupting kernels, restarting kernels, and changing the kernel associated with a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab supports extensions that add additional functionality and customizations. You can manage extensions from the Extensions Manager in the left sidebar.\n"
